        .col-md-10
          %p
            I'm TigerLionBear (NA). I started playing League of Legends two months ago.  As my first moba, I found the experience to be...overwhelming. With this guide, I hope to navigate hurdles I encountered to help you quickly bring value to the team. I'm a
            %s silver 
            gold player, but my goal is to
            %s at least catch up to my younger brother in gold
            reach platinum. You can follow my progress at

            Welcome to summoner's rift!

      .container.sub-section
        %h3 The right mindset
        .col-md-7
          %p
            The community has a toxic reputation. As a new player, you must be prepared to have a bad time. In the first match I unintentionally fed my lane so my teammates gave me a 'tip': Go uninstall the game.
          %p
            Since there are only 5 players per team, you significantly impact the outcome of any given match. Coupled with the fact that nobody likes to lose, it can spiral into a blame game where the loss is your fault. Learn to ignore everyone and just play.
          %p
            Here is the reality: while it is great to win, somebody has to lose. Don't get worked up over it. Even most pro players win only 50-60% of their matches.
          %p
            Additionally, the game was released in 2009 so players have been around for years. You can't be expected to be at the same skill level immediately. This includes players at 'your level', as smurfs (second accounts) are extremely prevalent. 
          %p
            Instead,
            %b ignore the haters and ragers.
            Focus only on yourself as you will be making mistakes that need to be fixed. It is not worth wasting time talking back to internet strangers. As you fix these mistakes, you will naturally climb up.

          %p
            A lot of the initial confusion and angst can be mitigated by having a friend to play with. If they are experienced, explanations will speed up your initiation into League. If they are also new, having someone to stumble around with is comforting. I would not have climbed so quickly without my friends and brother (shoutout to bouwser, LateNiteLazer, and viciouskittycat).

        %h2 Completing the tutorials

        .col-md-10
          %p
            Starting out, you will be asked how familiar you are with rts / moba games. Depending on your response, you will then be prompted to go into either the basic tutorial or battle training. 

          %p
            You don't have to do these tutorials immediately, they can be accessed anytime by hitting play at the top of the client. Both are straightforward and I recommend completing them, although there are caveats I would like to point out with each.

      .container.sub-section
        %h3 Basic tutorial notes

        .col-md-7
          %ul
            %li
              You play Ashe, a damage focused hero. In the tutorial, they tell you to buy thornmail, which is a defensive item. You will probably never do this again (99% of the time you want to get damage, damage, and moar damage).
            %li
              Minions only give gold when you deal the killing blow. Instead of mindlessly auto attacking them, account for your delay time and minion hp to ensure you get the last hit if other sources of damage are being applied. Last hitting is a crucial skill so you should start practicing it immediately.
            %li
              Skills don't damage towers or other structures, so firing Volley won't kill the tower quicker.
            %li
              After they show you how to unlock the camera with 'Y', you should keep it unlocked. You can always refocus on your champion with spacebar, but learn to play with the camera unlocked for better visibility.

        %h3 Battle training notes

        .col-md-10
          %ul
            %li 
              You are introduced to the main game map, Summoner's Rift. Here there are three lanes to choose from. You are also allowed to choose from three champions. It doesn't matter which lane or champion you select, although you should familiarize yourself with lanes and roles prior to playing a pvp match (sections below).
            %li
              You will get access to more skills, but don't forget about your auto attack. Auto attacks are your primary source of damage in most cases.
            %li
              Part of the tutorial has you enter the jungle and kill creeps, an alternative way to gain gold and experience. This is usually done by the jungler role. However, jungling is difficult to do early on as you lack item knowledge, are missing the Smite summoner skill, and won't have runes / masteries (they help a lot). I wouldn't worry about this until later.

        %h3 Keybindings & HUD

        .col-md-6
          %p
            The default settings work but aren't the greatest. Below are a few settings I recommend. Note: you need to be in game to access these settings so start up an empty custom game.

      .container.sub-section
        .col-md-6
          %p
            %b Quick cast -
            It is faster to just hit the key to "Quick Cast" skills. As you are new to the game, having the range indicators is beneficial so make sure "Display Range Indicators when using Quick Cast" is checked off (at the bottom). This makes the range indicator visible while the key is pressed down. Upon releasing the key, the skill is fired. You can cancel the skill by issuing a move command while the range indicator is visible.

          %p
            %b Minimap scale -
            Ensure the minimap scale is set to 100. Bigger means easier to look at (and you want to get into the habit of regularly checking it).
        .col-md-5.col-md-pull-7

        %h3 Roles in Summoner's Rift

        .col-md-10
          %p
            The roles described below are the ones most commonly found in the current meta (what the player base has shifted to and believes is the most effective). Try them all out to find what fits your play style! Because two go to bottom lane, you call the role instead of the lane in the pre-game lobby (support or adc).

          %p.sub-sub-section
            Once you have played a few games in these roles, watch
            %a{href: "https://www.youtube.com/user/unswlolsoc/videos"} unswlolsoc's video lectures
            for advanced role knowledge.

              %td Bottom
              %td They are utility based and have typically have crowd control skills. In team fights they are responsible for peeling enemies off the carries. They start with a gold supplement item and build a sight stone for vision control.

        %h3 Lanes in Summoner's Rift

        .col-md-7
          %p.sub-sub-section
            In the pre-game lobby you will need to call which lane you intend to go. Early on you will stay in your assigned area but as the game progresses, roaming and grouping for team fights is more prevalent. Roaming is leaving your area to help another lane, either to defend a tower or attempt to surprise and kill an enemy (gank).

          %table.table.table-hover
            %thead
              %tr

                %td Top
                %td Runs up the left and across the top of the map. Can roam to mid.
              %tr
                %td Mid
                %td Runs diagonal. Can roam to top or bot.
              %tr
                %td Bot
                %td Runs across the bottom and up the right of the map. Can roam to mid.
              %tr
                %td Jungle
                %td 
                  Not really a lane, but encompasses the jungle areas in between the lanes. Will be roaming the entire game. Probably the last position you will learn as it needs Smite (lv 3) and a few runes + masteries. Relies on killing creep camps for gold and experience. Learn the respawn timers for each camp!

        .col-md-10
          %p.sub-sub-section 
            Summoner spells are two skills that you can use with any champion. You set them in the pre-game lobby. Here is a link to the
            %a{href: "http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/summoners/spells/"} full list
            of summoner spells. Below I cover the ones that people actually use in Summoner's Rift.

              %td Ghost
              %td 1
              %td Lets you run faster for 10 seconds. You can use it defensively to run away or offensively to close the gap / catch opponents. I used this until I had access to Flash at level 12.
            %tr
              %td 
                %img{src: "images/summoner-heal.jpg", class: "img-responsive"}/
              %td Heal
              %td 1
              %td Restores health to you and a nearby champion. Also gives a speed boost for 1 second. Often used by the ADC as the speed boost can be used to catch fleeing opponents.
            %tr
              %td 
                %img{src: "images/summoner-teleport.jpg", class: "img-responsive"}/
              %td Teleport
              %td 2
              %td Teleports you to a friendly minion, tower, or ward. Can also be used on certain champion skills, such as Thresh's lantern. Teleporting to a tower shortens the cooldown. Often used by the top lane for mobility across the map or to return to their lane quickly.
            %tr
              %td 
                %img{src: "images/summoner-smite.jpg", class: "img-responsive"}/
              %td Smite
              %td 3
              %td A must have for jungling. Deals a lot of damage to creeps and enemy minions but cannot be used on enemy champions. It can however be used on champion minions, such as Tibbers.
            %tr
              %td 
                %img{src: "images/summoner-barrier.jpg", class: "img-responsive"}/
              %td Barrier
              %td 6
              %td An alternative to heal. Absorbs more damage than heal but does not boost speed. The least used of the spells I mention.
            %tr
              %td 
                %img{src: "images/summoner-ignite.jpg", class: "img-responsive"}/
              %td Ignite
              %td 8
              %td Deals damage to enemy champions over time. Often used by mid and top lanes.
            %tr
              %td 
                %img{src: "images/summoner-exhaust.jpg", class: "img-responsive"}/
              %td Exhaust
              %td 8
              %td Slows, halves damage output, and reduces attack speed on an enemy champion. Often used by supports on enemy carries or assassins to protect their carries from getting bursted down.
            %tr
              %td 
                %img{src: "images/summoner-flash.jpg", class: "img-responsive"}/
              %td Flash
              %td 12
              %td The most used spell. Unfortunately you don't get it until lv 12. Can be used to gap close or escape. Note: you can flash over some terrain such as ledges.

        %h3 Champion items

        .col-md-7
          %p
            The easiest way to deciding what items to purchase is to
            %b copy the better players.
            I use
            %a{href: "http://www.probuilds.net"} ProBuilds
            to lookup champions, then buy what pro players purchase (recent build orders, popular items). Don't worry if you don't understand what you are buying, the knowledge will come over time.

          %ul
            %li The official recommended item list in game isn't the greatest. Many recommendations are outdated.
            %li Always buy a trinket. It goes into your '4' item slot. They are free and infinite use. You will often want to get a Warding totem first.
            %li Items can have passive abilities and active abilities. Don't forget to use the actives, it is like having another skill.
            %li Rearrange the inventory so item actives are easier to press! For example, I put boots in the last slot since boots don't have actives.
            %li Make a mistake? As long as you haven't left the shopping area you can click 'undo'
            %li Look at opponent items with tab (see interface section) and build accordingly (ex: Randuin's for def if they are mostly atk dmg instead of Locket with magic resist)

        %h3 Runes and masteries

        .col-md-7
          %p
            Runes are purchased with IP. At level 20, you can use tier 3 runes, so I wouldn't bother buying runes until then. You gain one mastery point per level. I personally think the rune and mastery system is too complicated to worry about, 
            %b so just copy better players.

          %ul
            %li

        %p.sub-sub-section
          While there are other maps, I only cover Summoner's Rift as that is the 'main' game.

              %td AI (bots)
              %td Intermediate

              %td Players
              %td Normal Team Builder
              %td Available at lv 25. You select a champion and role beforehand, and a team is assembled based on your choice. You do not know who the opposing team has chosen until the game has started. No selection etiquette required.
            %tr
              %td Players
              %td Normal Blind Pick
              %td Available at lv 3. Here you just pick which champion you want to play and do not know who the opposing team has chosen until the game has started. The polite thing is to go by who calls what role / lane first in chat. However, this is not enforceable and who called first can differ due to lag.
            %tr
              %td Players
              %td Normal Draft Pick
              %td
                Available at lv 3. 
                %b Most closely resembles ranked
                as there is a champion banning phased followed by an alternating champion selection phase. I play this mode for ranked practice, unless I really want to play an often banned champion. Pick order is determined by the game, but it is best to work out roles in chat before locking in.
            %tr
              %td Players
              %td Ranked Solo / Duo
              %td 
                Available at lv 30. Same as Draft Pick except rated. Rankings are divided into Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Challenger. You will have to play an initial 10 matches to determine your standing. If you play with a partner, your hidden skill rating is boosted (so you play against slightly harder opponents).

        %h3 Interface notes

        %p While most of the interface is easy to pick up, there are two notes I want to make.

        .interface

          %p.teammates
            To the left is your team's status. You can tell 
            %b when their ultimate skill is available
            by the green circle.

          %p.tab 
            %b Hold tab in game for the scoreboard. 
            It shows opponent's items, creep score, and other stats. This information is updated the last time they were visible, so a lv 1 enemy may not be lv 1 anymore if they haven't been seen recently. Dead players are shown in red with a respawn timer. Enemies that are highlighted are currently visible on the map (Veigar and Malphite).

        .col-md-10
          %p In general you will want to do matches vs AI, then blind pick, then draft pick. Once lv 30 you are able to do ranked matches. Below I talk about each mode as well as areas to focus on. Most of the things to work on are elaborated on in the improving section.

        .col-md-7
          %p
            Until lv 3, you are required to do bot (vs AI) games. You are welcome to continue playing against them until you are comfortable enough to go against other players.
          %p 
            Bots do not follow the meta roles and instead send two top, one mid, and two bot. They also don't team fight properly. Because of this you can play any hero in any lane. Just get familiar with the game in general!

            %b Things to work on:
            %ul

        .col-md-6.col-md-offset-1.col-md-push-5

          %p
            While draft and blind pick are unlocked at the same time, I recommend moving to blind pick once you are ready to play against players. Here there is no pick order and no knowledge about opponents beforehand. As you will only be familiar with a few champions, the reasoning behind banning and counter picking in Draft will be a mystery anyways.

          %p Here you will start to figure out your preferred lanes, roles, and champions. 

          %p
            %b Things to work on:
            %ul
              %li all of the previous recommendations

        %h3 Draft pick pvp

        .col-md-6

          %p
            There is an inital ban phase followed by selection phase. Since you see your opponent's selections, you can opt to choose a 'counter' champion. Your team composition is also more thought out compared to Blind pick. For example, if your team's picks so far are squishy, someone should opt for a bruiser.

          %p
            At this point I recommend selecting a few roles and champions to 'main'.

          %p
            %b Things to work on:
            %ul
              %li all of the previous recommendations

        .col-md-6.col-md-offset-1.col-md-push-5

          %p 
            At lv 30 you can do ranked! However, don't jump in just yet. Before starting I recommend:

            %ul
              %li At least one full tier 3 rune page
              %li Proficiency with a backup role / lane
              %li At least 2 champions for each role you are comfortable with
              

          %p
            %br
            After 10 placement matches you will be placed in a tier and subdivision. Once placed, matches won will earn you LP. Reaching 100 LP qualifies you for a promotional series, a best of 3 for subdivision advancement and best of 5 for tier advancement.

          %p
            From here on you won't be getting levels anymore (30 is the cap). Instead, your ranking is a badge of how skilled you are. However, 
            %b don't forget this is a game!
            If you aren't having fun take a break from ranked.

        %h2 Ways to improve

        %p 
          %b Always just focus on yourself.
          You are the common factor in all your games. If you fix your mistakes and increase your game knowledge you will naturally climb the ranking ladder. Calling others out just lowers morale and diverts attention away from your own errors, so don't do it! 

        %p
          I also recommend you record and study your replays. What went well and why? What went poorly and why? How is your cs compared to your peers? I use 
          %a{href: "http://www.leaguereplays.com/"} this
          for replay recording as Riot hasn't added it to the game client yet. You don't have to have an account with them, just leave the program running while you play. Note: turn the fog of war on for your side so you can judge how good you calls are given the known information at the time.

        %p
          Below are specific areas you should focus on to significantly skill up.

            While kills are flashy and cool, minions are the primary source of gold. However, you only get gold for dealing the killing blow.
            %b This is the most important skill to learn.

          %p
            Because minions and towers attack each other, judging when and who to prioritize attacking is tricky and takes practice.

          %p
            Situational: full health minions that reach your tower wil require
            %ul
              %li Melee minions = 2 tower hits + your auto
              %li Ranged minions = 1 tower hit + your auto (may need a second auto if dmg is low)

            Trading is exchanging damage with the enemy champion.

            It is worth it if you dealt more damage in the trade.

            This puts a lot of pressure on them if you continuously win trades. It also makes last hitting difficult for them if done correctly. This is how you win your lane! Be sure to take into account minion aggro (below) and watch the video to learn how to do it correctly.

            Minions will start attacking you if you attack a nearby champion. At lower levels, this will deal a significant amount of damage to you. Make sure to take this into account when engaging champions.

            Lose aggro by going into the bushes (unless the minions have vision) or by running away.

        %h3 Attack move
        .col-md-10
          %p
            Attack move is the act of moving in between your attacks. Basically, attack, move, attack, move, etc. This is beneficial because:

            %ul.sub-sub-section
              %li constant movement helps dodge enemy skill shots
              %li it allows you to pursue fleeing opponents longer
              %li it allows you to apply counter pressure back while retreating

          %p
            While you can exclusively use your right mouse button, misclicking will cause you to walk instead of attack.
          %p
            One way people attack move properly is to use the 'A' key + left click for an auto attack with right click to move. Alternatively, you can reprogram your left mouse click for attack move by following

        %h3 Riot points
        %p
          RP is an alternative currency to the earned IP (influence points). It can be used to purchase anything except runes, and skins can only be purchased with RP. You start out with 400 RP but cannot earn any more in game. Usually you have to spend money to get more RP but there are two other methods to acquire RP.
        %p
          The first is to sign up for the free Bing rewards program and search with Bing instead of Google. You can use earned points to get a $5 Burger King gift card, which can then be redeemed for Riot Points in the client (an option in "Purchase RP" > Subway gift cards & more). Here is
          %a{href: "http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&CREA=RAW&rrid=_d6ea93ad-711b-b795-cdc9-bb4bd0c0b210"} my referral link
          to sign up
          %i.fa.fa-heart-o 

        %p
          The second method is to
          %a{href: "https://www.serve.com/leagueoflegends/"} sign up for the American Express Serve RP+ card.
          This is also free to do, and as a prepaid card does NOT affect your credit. However, you should be aware of 
          %a{href: "https://m.serve.com/fee-chart/"} monthly fees
          (which can be waived). It is pretty easy to get 13,000 RP with this.

        %p
          This is a bonus 150 IP for winning a game. It is automatically applied and is available again 22 hours after it was last applied. It is unaffected by boosts or game modes, so if you are in a rush just do a quick bot game.
