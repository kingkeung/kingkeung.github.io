        <h2>About this guide</h2>
        <p>
          I'm TigerLionBear (NA). I started playing League of Legends two months ago.  As my first moba, I found the experience to be...overwhelming. With this guide, I hope to navigate hurdles I encountered to help you quickly bring value to the team. I'm a silver player but my goal is to at least catch up to my younger brother in gold.

          Welcome to summoner's rift!
        </p>
        <p>
          I focus on Summoner's Rift 5v5, the most played map and game mode in LoL.

      <div class='container sub-section'>
        <h2>Before you begin</h2>
        <h3>The right mindset</h3>
        <div class='col-md-7'>
          <p>
            The community has a toxic reputation. As a new player, you must be prepared to have a bad time. In the first match I unintentionally fed my lane so my teammates gave me a 'tip': Go uninstall the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there are only 5 players per team, you significantly impact the outcome of any given match. Coupled with the fact that nobody likes to lose, it can spiral into a blame game where the loss is your fault. Learn to ignore everyone and just play.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the reality: while it is great to win, somebody has to lose. Don't get worked up over it. Even most pro players win only 50-60% of their matches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the game was released in 2009 so players have been around for years. You can't be expected to be at the same skill level immediately. This includes players at 'your level', as smurfs (second accounts) are extremely prevalent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead,
            <b>ignore the haters and ragers.</b>
            Focus only on yourself as you will be making mistakes that need to be fixed. It is not worth wasting time talking back to internet strangers. As you fix these mistakes, you will naturally climb up in rankings.

            A lot of the initial confusion and angst can be mitigated by having a friend to play with. If they are experienced, explanations will speed up your initiation into League. If they are also new, having someone to stumble around with is comforting. I would not have climbed so quickly without my friends and brother (shoutout to bouwser, LateNiteLazer, and viciouskittycat).

      <div class='container sub-section'>
        <h2>Completing the tutorials</h2>
        <p>
          Starting out, you will be asked how familiar you are with rts / moba games. Depending on your response, you will then be prompted to go into either the basic tutorial or battle training.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't have to do these tutorials immediately, they can be accessed anytime by hitting play at the top of the client. Both are straightforward and I recommend completing them, although there are caveats I would like to point out with each.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='container sub-section'>
        <h3>Basic tutorial notes</h3>
        <div class='col-md-7'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You play Ashe, a damage focused hero. In the tutorial, they tell you to buy thornmail, which is a defensive item. Never do this again (get damage, damage, and moar damage).
            </li>
            <li>
              Minions only give gold when you deal the killing blow. Instead of mindlessly auto attacking them, account for your delay time and minion hp to ensure you get the last hit if other sources of damage are being applied. Last hitting is a crucial skill so you should start practicing it immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Skills don't damage towers or other structures, so firing Volley won't kill the tower quicker.
            </li>
            <li>
              After they show you how to unlock the camera with 'Y', you should keep it unlocked. You can always refocus on your champion with spacebar, but learn to play with the camera unlocked for better visibility.
            </li>
          </ul>

      <div class='container sub-section'>
        <h3>Battle training notes</h3>
        <Ul>
          <li>
            You are introduced to the main game map, Summoner's Rift. Here there are three lanes to choose from. You are also allowed to choose from three champions. It doesn't matter which lane or champion you select, although you should familiarize yourself with lanes and roles prior to playing a pvp match.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will get access to more skills, but don't forget about your auto attack. Auto attacks are your primary source of damage in most cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Part of the tutorial has you enter the jungle and kill creeps, an alternative way to gain gold and experience. This is usually done by the jungler role. However, jungling is difficult to do early on as you lack item knowledge, are missing the Smite summoner skill, and won't have runes / masteries (they help a lot). I wouldn't worry about this until later.
          </li>
        </Ul>

        <h3>Keybindings & HUD</h3>
        <p>
          The default settings work but aren't the greatest. Below are a few settings I recommend. Note: you need to be in game to access these settings so start up an empty custom game.

            <b>Quick cast -</b>
            It is faster to just hit the key to "Quick Cast" skills. As you are new to the game, having the range indicators is beneficial so make sure "Display Range Indicators when using Quick Cast" is checked off (at the bottom). This makes the range indicator visible while the key is pressed down. Upon releasing the key, the skill is fired.

          The roles described below are the ones most commonly found in the current meta (what the player base has shifted to and believes is the most effective). Try them all out to find what fits your play style! Because two go to bottom lane, you call the role instead of the lane in the pre-game lobby (support or adc).

          There are also champions that are very cheap (450 IP - 1350 IP) that you can quickly pick up. All the 450 IP champs are worth it in my opinion, as well as most of the 1350 IP champs. Below are specific ones I wanted to highlight.

            The easiest way to deciding what items to purchase is to
            <b>copy the better players.</b>
            I use
            <a href='http://www.probuilds.net'>ProBuilds</a>
            to lookup champions, then buy what pro players purchase (recent build orders, popular items). Don't worry if you don't understand what you are buying, the knowledge will come over time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The official recommended item list in game isn't the greatest. Many recommendations are outdated.</li>
            <li>Always buy a trinket. It goes into your '4' item slot. They are free and infinite use. You will often want to get a Warding totem first.</li>
            <li>Items can have passive abilities and active abilities. Don't forget to use the actives, it is like having another skill.</li>
            <li>Rearrange the inventory so item actives are easier to press! For example, I put boots in the last slot since boots don't have actives.</li>
            <li>Make a mistake? As long as you haven't left the shopping area you can click 'undo'</li>

            Runes are purchased with IP. At level 20, you can use tier 3 runes, so I wouldn't bother buying runes until then. You gain one mastery point per level. I personally think the rune and mastery system is too complicated to worry about,

          RP is an alternative currency to the earned IP (influence points). It can be used to purchase anything except runes, and skins can only be purchased with RP. You start out with 400 RP but cannot earn any more in game. Usually you have to spend money to get more RP but there are two other methods to acquire RP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first is to sign up for the free Bing rewards program and search with Bing instead of Google. You can use earned points to get a $5 Burger King gift card, which can then be redeemed for Riot Points in the client (an option in "Purchase RP" > Subway gift cards & more). Here is
          <a href='http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&amp;CREA=RAW&amp;rrid=_d6ea93ad-711b-b795-cdc9-bb4bd0c0b210'>my referral link</a>
          to sign up
          <i class='fa fa-heart-o'></i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The second method is to
          <a href='https://www.serve.com/leagueoflegends/'>sign up for the American Express Serve RP+ card.</a>
          This is also free to do, and as a prepaid card does NOT affect your credit. However, you should be aware of
          <a href='https://m.serve.com/fee-chart/'>monthly fees</a>
          (which can be waived). It is pretty easy to get 13,000 RP with this.
