      <div class='container sub-section'>
        <h3>The right mindset</h3>
        <div class='col-md-7'>
          <p>
            The community has a toxic reputation. As a new player, learn to
            <b>ignore the haters and ragers.</b>
            In the first match I unintentionally fed my lane so my teammates gave me a 'tip': Go uninstall the game. I didn't and I'm having a blast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since there are only 5 players per team, you significantly impact the outcome of every match. Coupled with the fact that nobody likes to lose, it can spiral into a blame game where the loss is your fault. Just play and have fun. You can silence people who get on your nerves by bringing up the scoreboard (tab) and muting in the right column.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is the reality they don't get: while it is great to win, somebody has to lose. Even most pro players win only 50-60% of their matches.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the game was released in 2009 so players have been around for years. You can't be expected to be at the same skill level immediately. This includes players at 'your level', since smurfs (second accounts) are extremely prevalent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Focus only on yourself as you will be making mistakes that need to be fixed. It is not worth wasting time talking back to internet strangers. As you fix these mistakes, you will naturally climb up.

          <p>
            A lot of the initial confusion and angst can be mitigated by having a friend to play with. If they are experienced, explanations will speed up your initiation into League. If they are also new, having someone to stumble around with is comforting. I would not have climbed so quickly without my friends and brother (shoutout to bouwser, LateNiteLazer, and viciouskittycat).

        <h2>Completing the tutorials</h2>
        <div class='col-md-10'>
          <p>
            Starting out, you will be asked how familiar you are with rts / moba games. Depending on your response, you will then be prompted to go into either the basic tutorial or battle training.
          </p>
          <p>
            You don't have to do these tutorials immediately, they can be accessed anytime by hitting play at the top of the client. Both are straightforward and I recommend completing them, although there are caveats I would like to point out with each.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class='container sub-section'>
        <h3>Basic tutorial notes</h3>
        <div class='col-md-7'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You play Ashe, a damage focused hero. In the tutorial you buy thornmail, which is a defensive item. You will probably never do this again with her (99% of the time you want to get damage and moar damage).
            </li>
            <li>
              Minions only give gold if you deal the killing blow. Instead of mindlessly auto attacking them, account for your delay time and minion hp to ensure you get the last hit. Last hitting is a crucial skill so start practicing it immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              Skills don't damage towers or other structures, so firing Volley (Ashe's W skill) won't kill the tower quicker.
            </li>
            <li>
              After they show you how to unlock the camera with 'Y', you should keep it unlocked. You can always refocus on your champion with spacebar, but learn to play with the camera unlocked for better visibility.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>Battle training notes</h3>
        <div class='col-md-10'>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You are introduced to the main game map, Summoner's Rift. Here there are three lanes to choose from. You are also allowed to choose from three champions. It doesn't matter which lane or champion you select, although you should familiarize yourself with lanes and roles prior to playing a pvp match (sections below).
            </li>
            <li>
              You will get access to more skills, but don't forget about your auto attack. Auto attacks are your primary source of damage in most cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              Part of the tutorial has you enter the jungle and kill creeps, an alternative way to gain gold and experience. This is usually done by the jungler role. However, jungling is difficult to do early on as you lack item knowledge, are missing the Smite summoner skill, and won't have runes / masteries. I wouldn't worry about this until later.
            </li>
          </ul>

            The default settings work but aren't the greatest. Below are a few settings I recommend. Note: you need to be in game to access these settings so start up an empty custom game.

            <b>Quick cast -</b>
            It is faster to just hit the key to "Quick Cast" skills. As you are new to the game, having the range indicators is beneficial so make sure "Display Range Indicators when using Quick Cast" is checked off (at the bottom). This makes the range indicator visible while the key is pressed down. Upon releasing the key, the skill is fired. You can cancel the skill by issuing a move command while the range indicator is visible.

            The roles below are the most commonly found in the current meta (what the player base has shifted to and believes is the most effective). Try them all out to find what fits your play style! *Because two go to bottom lane, you call the role instead of the lane in the pre-game lobby (support or adc).

            There are also very cheap champions (450 IP - 1350 IP) you can quickly pick up. All the 450 IP champs are worth it in my opinion, as well as most of the 1350 IP champs. There is also a starter pack available for 530 RP which has 8 of the 450 IP champions, an IP boost, and a XP boost. Below are specific champions I want to highlight.

            The easiest way to deciding what items to purchase is to
            <b>copy the better players.</b>
            I use
            <a href='http://www.probuilds.net'>ProBuilds</a>
            to lookup champions, then buy what pro players purchase (recent build orders, popular items). Don't worry if you don't understand what you are buying, the knowledge will come over time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The official recommended item list in game isn't the greatest. Many recommendations are outdated.</li>
            <li>Always buy a trinket. It goes into your '4' item slot. They are free and infinite use. You will often want to get a Warding totem first.</li>
            <li>Items can have passive abilities and active abilities. Don't forget to use the actives, it is like having another skill.</li>
            <li>Rearrange the inventory so item actives are easier to press! For example, I put boots in the last slot since boots don't have actives.</li>
            <li>Make a mistake? As long as you haven't left the shopping area you can click 'undo'</li>
            <li>Look at opponent items with tab (see interface section) and build accordingly (ex: Randuin's for def if they are mostly atk dmg instead of Locket with magic resist)</li>

            Runes are purchased with IP. At level 20, you can use tier 3 runes, so I wouldn't bother buying runes until then. You gain one mastery point per level. I personally think the rune and mastery system is too complicated to worry about,

            While draft and blind pick are unlocked at the same time, I recommend moving to blind pick once you are ready to play against players. Here there is no pick order and no knowledge about opponents beforehand. As you will only be familiar with a few champions, the reasoning behind banning and counter picking in Draft will be a mystery anyways.

            There is an inital ban phase followed by selection phase. Since you see your opponent's selections, you can opt to choose a 'counter' champion. Your team composition is also more thought out compared to Blind pick. For example, if your team's picks so far are squishy, someone should opt for a bruiser. Requires owning 16 champions.

          <p>
            At lv 30 you can do ranked! However, don't jump in just yet. Before starting I recommend:
            <ul>
              <li>At least one full tier 3 rune page</li>
              <li>Proficiency with a backup role / lane</li>
              <li>At least 2 champions for each role you are comfortable with</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            After 10 placement matches you will be placed in a tier and subdivision. Once placed, matches won will earn you LP. Reaching 100 LP qualifies you for a promotional series, a best of 3 for subdivision advancement and best of 5 for tier advancement.
          </p>
          <p>
            From here on you won't be getting levels anymore (30 is the cap). Instead, your ranking is a badge of how skilled you are. However,

        <h2>Ways to improve</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Always just focus on yourself.</b>
          You are the common factor in all your games. If you fix your mistakes and increase your game knowledge you will naturally climb the ranks. Calling others out just lowers morale and diverts attention away from your own errors, so don't do it!
        </p>
        <p>
          I recommend you record and study your replays. What went well and why? What went poorly and why? How is your cs compared to your peers? I use
          <a href='http://www.leaguereplays.com/'>this</a>
          for replay recording as Riot hasn't added it to the game client yet. You don't have to have an account with them, just leave the program running while you play. Turn the fog of war on for your side so you can judge how good you calls are given the known information at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are specific areas you should focus on to significantly skill up.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='container sub-section'>
        <h3>Last hitting</h3>
        <div class='col-md-6'>
          <p>
            While kills are flashy and cool, minions are the primary source of gold. However, you only get gold for dealing the killing blow.
            <b>This is the most important skill to learn.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Because minions and towers attack each other, judging when and who to prioritize attacking is tricky and takes practice.
            <a href='http://i.imgur.com/orWUCKH.png'>Here</a>
            are some exercises you can do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Situational: full health minions that reach your tower will require
            <ul>
              <li>Melee minions = 2 tower hits + your auto</li>
              <li>Ranged minions = 1 tower hit + your auto (may need a second auto if dmg is low)</li>

          <p>
            Trading is exchanging damage with the enemy champion.
            <b>Don't be afraid!</b>
            It is worth it if you dealt more damage in the trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            This puts a lot of pressure on them if you continuously win trades. It also makes last hitting difficult for them if done correctly. This is how you win your lane! Be sure to take into account minion aggro (below) and watch the video to learn how to do it correctly.

        <h3>Attack move</h3>
        <div class='col-md-10'>
          <p>
            Attack move is the act of moving in between your attacks. Basically, attack, move, attack, move, etc. This is beneficial because:
            <ul class='sub-sub-section'>
              <li>constant movement helps dodge enemy skill shots</li>
              <li>it allows you to pursue fleeing opponents longer</li>
              <li>it allows you to apply counter pressure while retreating</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            While you can exclusively use your right mouse button, misclicking will cause you to move instead of attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way people attack move properly is to use the 'A' key + left click for an auto attack with right click to move. Alternatively, you can reprogram your left mouse click for attack move by following

        <h3>Map awareness</h3>
        <div class='col-md-8'>
          <p>
            Map awareness consists of two parts, having vision (warding) and actually checking it regularly (minimap).
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Warding is the key to maintaining control of the map</b>
            as it lets you catch opponents out of position, swinging the game in your favor. You can have three stealth (green) wards and one vision (pink) active at once. Starting out you can get a trinket which places a weaker version of the stealth ward. This trinket can be upgraded to put down one normal stealth / vision ward later in the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supports and junglers can purchase a sightstone, which allows placement of multiple stealth wards. If you do this, replace the ward trinket with a sweeping lens (to remove enemy wards). Otherwise, manually purchase stealth wards for 75 gold and vision wards for 100 gold.
          </p>
          <p>
            While warding is one of the support role's primary responsibilities,
            <b>it is not only their responsibility.</b>
            Everyone should pitch in due, the exception being ADCs. While you may initially think 75 or 100 gold is better spent on permanent stat giving items, the intangible benefits are well worth it. In fact, the number of wards placed correlates with skill level. Pro players will place many wards. Bronze players will place none. You can check how you are doing in terms of ward quantity with
            <a href='http://wardscore.loltools.net/'>this ward score tool.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            However, ward placement is equally important. Starting out, you can refer to
            <a href='http://gamefolio.co/posts/190'>these diagrams</a>
            for common spots, but branch out as you get a better understanding of warding. Is baron or dragon going to be up soon? Have vision of it. Are you on the offensive? Ward their jungle. Are you forced to play defensively? Ward your jungle. Lose a tower? Ward to maintain vision of that lane. Note: if you intend to place a ward in a bush, ensure that the placement cursor is green.
          </p>
          <p>
            So now that you have wards, make sure you actually use them by
            <b>regularly checking the minimap.</b>
            If you see something, ping it! Noticing the enemy jungler headed to top lane could save your teammate's life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking at the minimap regularly is probably something you will have to train yourself to do. One drill is to set a timer on an infinite loop (there are websites that this, such as
            <a href='http://www.online-stopwatch.com/loop-countdown/'>this one</a>
            ) which goes off every 15 seconds. Look at the minimap when it goes off. How many enemy players do you see? Where are they? Where are your teammates? Once you get the hang of this, shorten the timer. Repeat until you automatically and frequently check it.

            In team fights positioning is key, with your target depending on your role. Sometimes people will say "focus the carries". This is actually not correct as explained by
            <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaRR0oJnqDw'>TheOddOne.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            Team fighting is difficult to explain with text so watch the embedded tutorial video! It goes through each role extensively.

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <div class='col-md-8 col-md-offset-1 col-md-push-3'>
          <p>
            Kills do not win games, objectives do. So what are objectives? I classify them as the nexus, inhibitors, towers, baron, and dragon, with inner towers being more important to take than outer ones. These primary objectives provide gold or other benefits that outweigh kills in most cases. For example, destroying an inhibitor will buff your minions to a point where the enemy team is forced to deal with them. Similarly, taking a tower both provides team gold and denies the enemy vision of that spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the problems with a kill focused mentality is that you are tempted to sacrifice opportunities to take or defend objectives for kills. If you and your teammates spend time chasing one enemy and the rest of your opponents get baron, that is a very bad exchange. If you go one for one in a 1 v 2 instead of staying alive to defend, that remaining enemy may be able to take a tower.

        <h3>Face checking bushes</h3>
        <div class='col-md-7'>
          <p>
            Bushes block both vision within and around them so enemies could be hiding inside.
            <b>Don't walk in or near them</b>
            unless you absolutely know where your opponents are or can test the bush.
          </p>
          <p>
            To test if someone is inside, toss a ward in or fire a skill in. Certain skills, such as Soraka's Starcall will be usable if an enemy is nearby. Other skills such as Thresh's lantern will give you vision. If you have Spellthief's Edge with stacks, getting gold means someone is waiting to wreck your face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wards within bushes will give you vision around the bush as well (if placed properly).

        <h3>Pressure concept</h3>
        <div class='col-md-10'>
          <p>
            Most low elo players interpret carrying your team as assuming your teammates are useless and trying to get to a point where you can 1 v 5 the enemy team. In my opinion, this is wrong and impossible to do unless you are entire tiers above your opponents (ex: a platinum player smurfing bronze). Instead, I view carrying your team as
            <b>generating constant pressure on your opponents.</b>
            Basically become a distraction for your opponents, making it easier for your teammates by diverting attention away. Pressure also forces the enemy to do things they do not want to and lets you set the pace of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Things like winning your lane will generate pressure. In one replay, my bottom lane was winning decisively. As a result, the enemy team kept pinging for assistance from their jungler, whose multiple ganks failed because my lane was well warded. The number of pings was absurd and their frustration was apparent even without chat shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, this wasted the jungler's time and caused them to fall behind every time they came to gank my lane. Additionally, while he is at bot he can't gank mid or top, making it easier for the other lanes to win. Finally, this probably caused in-fighting. "GG no ganks, worthless jungler" or "GG, noob bot lane feeding".
          </p>
          <p>
            In the scenario where you are losing lane and ganks fail, it is better to farm defensively. If you try to "catch up" by making plays, you will probably make mistakes and feed the enemy further, applying pressure to your own team instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            "But I always win my lane and still lose". In order to carry the game, you need to
            <b>continue to apply pressure, even after the laning phase.</b>
            Win bot? Go ward the enemy jungle and push the inner tower. Go roam and help other lanes. Go get dragon. Go farm the enemy's jungle creeps so they lose buffs and farm. Keep it up until the game is over.

            RP is an alternative currency to the earned IP (influence points). It can be used to purchase anything except runes, and skins can only be purchased with RP. You start out with 400 RP but cannot earn any more in game. Usually you have to spend money to get more RP but there are two other methods to acquire RP. Note:

            The first method is to

            This is also free to do, and as a prepaid card does NOT affect your credit. However, you should be aware of
            <a href='https://m.serve.com/fee-chart/'>monthly fees</a>
            (which can be waived). It is pretty easy to get 13,000 RP with this.
